# Rules
Rules for the [Endworld Pen And Paper](endworld/intro) System

## The Selector System

This system uses ten-sided dice.
A **Check** is a roll of 5 dice interpreted in a specific way, with the result describing how successful the attempted action was.

Whenever there is advantage or disadvantage of any kind, **Bonus or Penalty Dice** may be applicable, increasing the number of dice rolled.

The roll is interpreted by your **Selectors**, which are usually defined by the applicable attribute and skills, but may also be static or equipment-based.
The dice in the roll are ordered in ascending order.

To get the result of the roll (or to **interpret** the roll), each selector **selects** a die by position from the bottom.
Selected dice are then added.

* Selectors greater than 5 select the 5th die.
* A selector of 0 or less selects no die.
* The usual number of selectors is 2.

The effects and result of the Check may then be further modified by **Resonance**.

A Check usually involves a [Character](endworld/ewchar)s Attributes and Skills, but might also use Selectors from [Equipment](endworld/equipment)

## Bonus and Penalty Dice

Bonus and Penalty Dice cancel each other out before the roll.

Any remaining Bonus or Penalty Dice are rolled along with the normal dice.

* If Bonus Dice are rolled, the same number of **lowest** dice are removed.
* For Penalty Dice, the **highest** are removed instead.

Bonus and Penalty Dice do not change the number of dice being interpretedâ€”only the relative chances.

## Resonance

Resonance occurs when, in a roll, more than one die shows the same number.

* The Resonance **amplitude** is the number of matching dice **past the first**.
* The Resonance **frequency** is the number those dice show.

If no effect specifies anything about Resonance, it has no effect.


## Interpretation

In many places the degrees of success are given by a Formatting such as [3,7,17], also called Threshholds, which means that one degree of success is achieved for a roll or value checked against it, for every number inside that was reached or overcome. A Roll of 9 against the difficulties stated earlier, would reach 3 and 7, but not 17, and thus represent 2 degrees of success, whose meanings depend on the Situation.


# Broad Skills

Broad skills encompass a wide range of activities, listed inside it and has opportunities for specialization and Gaps
A Gap is a listed subskill which the Broad Skill does not apply to, and a specialization provides a [bonus die](endworld/ewrules#bonus-and-penalty-dice) when the broadskill is used for that purpose.
At level 1, one Skillgap may be taken in exchange for a specialization if the way of learning the skill might have focussed on one part of it, while neglecting another.
At level 2, if the opportunity for study arises in game another specialization can be picked.
Specializations and Skillgaps do not affect the Attribute contribution of a Broad Skill
