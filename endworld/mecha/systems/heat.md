# Heat
Heat generated by other systems go to the fluxpool

**Notes**:

* **Radiator Wings**: 5 turns to deploy. Vulnerable while extended. (no armor applies)
* **Coolant Dump**: Discharges 25 heat + 25L Coolant as a decoy mist or smoke screen.
* **Overdrive**: Once activated, the fluxpool is uncapped, heat in the flux pool instead annihilates heat when assigned to a sink. Mech shuts once the fluxpool either stays full or all the heat has been annihilated.. Requires repair (`Practice, Gadgets` check) afterward. While this  is running the mech acts twice as fast. 
* **Fractal Heatsink**: Can be activated to STOP its heat output, which is useful for stealth
