# Movement Systems

Movement systems provide the propulsive force for the mech. Mecha movement is determined by raw power against weight and the environment.

## Factors

*   **Thrust**: The propulsive force generated by the movement systems (roughly in kiloNewtons). For most systems, this scales with the weight of the module installed (**Thrust/t**).
*   **Mass**: The total weight of the mecha, including all modules and cargo (Tons).
*   **Speed**: The velocity relative to terrain is usually given in km/h.

## Stats

### Anchor
The **Anchor** represents the Weight based hurdle to overcome to get moving at all.
The higher the Anchor stat of a movementsystem, the bigger the role in how much energy is required to move. 

### Dynamics
The **Dynamics** stat represents aerodynamic efficiency and mechanical smoothness. 
Low Dynamics represent high air resistance or other factors that dominate at high speeds, while high Dynamics means the System is well optimized for reaching high speeds.

## Acceleration

A mecha continues to accelerate as long as its net force (**Thrust** minus friction and drag) is positive.

**Speed Calculations**:

The mecha's speed is calculated iteratively in 0.1-second intervals until it reaches a steady state (where acceleration becomes negligible).

1.  **Forces**:
    *   **Thrust**: `Thrust * Amount` (in kN).
    *   **Friction**: `Anchor * Total Mecha Mass` (in kN).
    *   **Drag**: 
        *   If Dynamics is 0: `Speed³`
        *   Otherwise: `Speed² / (Dynamics / 10)`
2.  **Acceleration**: `(Thrust - Friction - Drag) / Total Mass` (in m/s²).
3.  **Speed Update**: `Speed = Speed + (Acceleration * 0.1)`.
4.  **Steady State**: The calculation stops when acceleration drops below 0.001 m/s².

**Rule of Thumb**:
For quick reference without a computer, you can estimate a mecha's performance using these formulas:

1.  **Net Force**: `(Thrust * Amount) - (Anchor * Total Mass)`
2.  **Top Speed (km/h)**:
    *   If Dynamics > 0: `3.6 * sqrt(Net Force * Dynamics / 10)`
    *   If Dynamics = 0: `3.6 * (Net Force)^(1/3)`
3.  **Acceleration Duration (Time to 90% Speed)**:
    *   If Dynamics > 0: `4.7 * Total Mass * sqrt(Dynamics / Net Force)` seconds.
    *   If Dynamics = 0: `10 * Total Mass / (Net Force)^(2/3)` seconds.

*Example*: A 20-ton mecha with 200kN Thrust, 1.5 Anchor, and 5 Dynamics:
*   Net Force = 200 - (1.5 * 20) = 170.
*   Top Speed = 3.6 * sqrt(170 * 5 / 10) ≈ 33 km/h.
*   Duration (90%) = 4.7 * 20 * sqrt(5 / 170) ≈ 16 seconds.
