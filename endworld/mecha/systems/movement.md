**Speed Calculations**:

under construction!

calculate base friction by calculating (Anchor/100)*total mech weight 
Thrust (times tonnage) divided by the total weight of the mech is acceleration
net acceleration is acceleration - base friction
Maximum speed is the square root of (10 * Dynamics * net acceleration)
Example
60 ton mech with thrust 60 at anchor 1
friction is 0.6
acceleration =  60/60 = 1
net_accel = 0.4
sqrt(10*15*0.4)=7.75 m/s (ir roughly 27 kmh)
at 2 tons that would be  net_accel of 1.4 raising speed to 14.5 m/s or 18 with 3tons
(which is 52km/h and 64 km/h respectively)
filling the mech somehow with 50% tracks:
acceleration = 59.4 ==> 66 m/s 


acceleration duration is sqrt(dynamics*10)/sqrt(net_acceleration)*3 rounds ... ish... for now



* **Friction**:
  `F = Mass * Ground Coefficient / 100 * 9.81`

* **Air Drag**:

  ```
  Airdrag = (49 * SpeedÂ² * Area) / 80
  Speed = Power / (Friction + Airdrag)
  ```
