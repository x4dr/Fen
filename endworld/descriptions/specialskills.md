# Special Skills

## Skills
### Critical Eye

### Bloodletting

TODO


### Reservoir

When the Characters [Contamination](endworld/contamination) exceeds their Resistance, this skill may be used to contain the additional contamination, only one effect can be applied until  the Contamination is brought below Resistance.
Focus - for short term situations, lowers the (just applied) Ingress Wound by [5,8,11,14,17,20]
Intuition - +[5,10,15,17,20] Bonus dice on usages of Contamination, and Malus dice on resisting and healing. 
Discipline - The influence of contamination on [healing](endworld/healing) is lowered by [5,8,11,14,17,20] for one week. 

### Contamination Restoration

While Contamination exceeds Resistance, this skill can be used in Healing.

### Cortex Drive

This skill represents a pilot’s ability to push their control in battle via neural implants.  
When activated, it can be used as a third selector during a roll that would benefit from faster or more precise control. For each Resonance triggered in the roll, the pilot suffers one wound of severity equal to the Amplitude of that Resonance.

### Anechoic
Perks/Passives
Anechoic can be used once per Scene:
Level 1: You may choose (before a roll) that there will be no resonances whatsoever
Level 2: You may choose a Resonance frequency to Ignore.
Level 3: You may, after rolling, decide which resonances to apply and which to ignore.

### Ranged Mech Weapons 

This [Broad Skill](endworld/ewrules#Broad Skills) Covers all weapons too large to be handheld, including mounted turrets and vehicle-grade systems, usually mech weapons.
Usually used with the [Focus](endworld/descriptions/attributes#special) Attribute and another skill depending on Tactics, surroundings or Systems.

This group of 7 Skills starts with 3 Skillgaps by default.

#### Weapon Types
*  Laser - "Directed Energy Weapons" that fire pure energy. Use no ammo, just energy. Weaker raw damage, but pinpoint accuracy and excellent visual feedback in particulate-heavy air.
*  Ballistics - Classic "guns" that fire solid projectiles. Use various ammo types. High kinetic force, versatile but ammo-dependent.
* Missile - Self-propelled weapons that travel independently.
Slower, heavier, expensive — but depending on the Missile can ignore shields and can deliver payloads like explosives or devices.

#### Attack Modes

* **Direct** – Aimed and fired directly at the target. Requires line of sight.
* **Indirect** – Fired in arcs or lobbed. Needs target coordinates but ignores LoS.
* **Seeking** – Guided via sensors or datalinks. Will track as long as lock is active.
* **Beam** – Sustained streams of damage. Easy to aim, costly to maintain, less flexible.

### Mech Melee

Massive close-range weapons. Unmatched in close quarters, but nearly useless at range.

* **Sharp** – High speed, precision. Relies on mech movement systems to reset quickly.
* **Blunt** – Slower, easier to dodge, but hits like artillery.
* **Unarmed** – No dedicated weapon; used for grappling, disabling, and improvisation.
