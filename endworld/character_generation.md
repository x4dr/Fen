# Characters 

Each character consists of foundational traits: 
* **Attributes**
* **Skills**
* **Core Stats**
 
which together reflect their capabilities, aptitudes, and resilience in a world shaped by technological ruin and environmental hostility.

---

## Attributes and Skills

**Attributes** represent broad inherent capabilities. They define how effective a character is in a general domain of action and are usually one of two **Selectors**. Attributes range from 1 (incapable) to 5 (peak human potential) and are derived from the total Score of Skills in that Category.

The Attributes of a Category have one point among them by default, but another Attribute point may be spent for every second level after. 

An Attribute of 0 means the associated actions usually fail and the character is disabled in some way. Attributes from 1-5 represent increasing Adeptness, with a level of 1 being a weak point of the character, 2 being general competence. 3 being a strong point, 4 being extraordinary in that attribute and 5 being as adept as a human can be.
## The Categories

Each character’s competencies are divided into five **Categories**. These represent the broad areas in which skills are grouped and influence how a character interacts with the world, others, and their own potential. Categories are used to organize Skills and determine Attribute levels through accumulated expertise.

* **[Physical](endworld/descriptions/physicalskills)** — Covers personal interaction with the physical environment.

* **[Social](endworld/descriptions/socialskills)** — Involves communication, influence, and interaction with other characters or sentient actors.

* **[Mental](endworld/descriptions/mentalskills)** — Governs perception, analysis, knowledge and internal processing of information.

* **[Ability](endworld/descriptions/abilityskills)** — Applies to general capability, adaptability, and tasks tied to a character’s role or identity.

* **[Special](endworld/descriptions/specialskills)** — Represents unique mechanics that can define a character’s gameplay.

### Skills

**Skills** are trained proficiencies tied to Categories. Each Skill reflects specific knowledge or competence and is rated from 1 to 3:

* **1** – Proficient: basic training or general experience
* **2** – Skilled: advanced use or professional level
* **3** – Exceptional: while others may be as good, it is impossible to find someone who is clearly better.

## Core Stats

In addition to Attributes and Skills, each character possesses three Core Stats, representing Characteristics that are not learned or (not usually) improved over the course of the game

* **Resistance** reflects the character’s capacity to endure [Contamination](endworld/contamination) and escape grievous Injury.
* **Fate** captures narrative weight, [luck](endworld/Fate), and unrealized potential.
* **Affinity** measures the intuitive and technical ability to operate [Technologies](endworld/techlevels).

Each Core Stat ranges from 1-5, inclusive. Their total always adds up to 10

Surviving heavy Contamination might increase Resistance, Surviving dramatic, traumatic danger might increase Fate and a dramatic moment with Technology or long time immersion into a high tech Environment may increase affinity, at the detriment of another Core stat.

## Skill Point Distribution

Categories are ordered and then Skill levels are divided among them: Each point represents one level in a skill, although level 3 skills should be exceedingly rare and well explained. 


* **Primary** – 12 points
* **Secondary** – 10 points
* **Tertiary** – 8 points
* **Quaternary** – 6 points
* **Quinary** – 4 points

 Unused Skill points are retained for later allocation into Attribute levels.

## Finalization 

Character creation concludes when Skill points are spent and derived Attributes calculated. Skill choices should reflect the character’s background and narrative role:

* Level 1 Skills should be present in the backstory.
* Level 2 Skills should be justified with specific backgrounds, and character defining lived experience.
* Level 3 Skills require a strong narrative rationale.

Skill and Attribute development continues during play through roleplay, training, and downtime progression. 
Points may be allocated at any point after their prerequisites are met - as long as they fit into the narrative.
