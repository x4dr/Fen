These entries are generally equivalent in value. Local supply and demand may vary prices.  
If there's no in-world reason for variance, roll for it:

**Price variance formula**:

> `((−1)^1d10 × 1d10 × 5)%`

Additionally, traders keep a share of the value for themselves:

| Threshold | 0  | 5  | 8  | 11 | 14 | 17 | 20 |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Kept %    | 50 | 33 | 20 | 10 | 5  | 2  | 0  |

> Goods at **100% value** are equivalent to one another, and each line equals **4 character creation points**.

## Example

Character A wants to trade **5t of Base Tech Parts (BTP)** for **Alacast**.

### Step 1: Price rolls

- **BTP value roll**: 6, 4 → `((−1)^6 × 4 × 5)% = +20%`
    
- **Alacast value roll**: 10, 3 → `((−1)^10 × 3 × 5)% = +15%`
    

**Exchange rate**:  
`(500 × 1.15) / (100 × 1.2) = 4.79`

So:

> `5000kg of BTP = 1043g Alacast`

### Step 2: Barter roll

- Player rolls Resolve + Trade = 3, 2
    
- Merchant keeps 10% (from rolled threshold)
    

Result:

> `938g Alacast received`
