# Attunement Magic
## General Parameters
**Source:** Magic attunement (cards)  
**Concept:** Activating Magic attunement in reagents to achieve effects (Alchemical Magic)  
**Aspect:** Alchemy    
## Mechanics
### Magic attunement
Use a (irl) 52 card french suite card deck (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A worth their respective numbers or 10 for JQK and 11 *or* 1 (player's choice) for A)
Your **hand size** is **2+Source.level**, if there are more cards in your hand than your hand size allows, immediately discard one card of your choice.
The colors for this purpose mean: Diamonds - **O**rder | Clubs - **M**atter | Hearts - **E**nergy | Spades - e**N**tropy
Spells require a certain **mix of magic**, a **casting time** and a **material component**.
When the spell is cast (no matter if successfully or not), the used cards go to the discard pile.
When you have **no cards left**, you are **out of mana** and need to **meditate**. See below.
When you have **no material components**, you have **nothing to activate**. See regular [alchemy](/3d10/alchemy) on how to make more if you run out.
When you have **no time**, use **mundane** methods of effecting change.
### Concentrating
Requires *one action* and draws *one card*.

When you *concentrate* look at *as many cards as you have levels in alchemical magic* before you draw, put them back on top of your deck in any order.

### Dedicating
Means withholding the most powerful (player chooses on cast) card from your discard pile after casting, for as long as the dedication lasts. Put it on a separate pile. This **does not count against your hand size**, but prevents you from using it again for as long as it remains dedicated. Dedicated cards can be taken back into the deck while meditating, one at a time, effects sustained by dedicated cards end when the card is taken back.

### Sustaining
Is similar to dedication, but requires more effort and **counts against your hand size**. Lower it by 1 for each sustained effect for its duration. Sustaining can be dropped at will as a free action.  

### Meditation
Requires at least **six hours** in sufficient calmness with no other activity and shuffles all the cards from the discard pile into the deck. One dedicated card may be taken back into the deck.  


# Alchemy
## Perks
3XP each. Additional perks are open for debate.
### Genius
* Genius 1: put a joker into your deck. jokers satisfy one magic type in a spell _completely_, but don't add anything to generic magic, OR they add 12 generic magic  
* Genius 2: put a joker into your deck, put a blank card into your deck.  
* Genius 3: put a joker into your deck, put two blank cards into your deck.  
### Amass Magic
* 1-13: you may put one card for each color into your deck, starting from the bottom (2 is the lowest, an Ace counts as highest), everytime you meditate. You can also remove the added Cards, starting from the top. You can only have as many extra cards per color, as you have levels in Amass Magic. Only one card can be taken out or added in this way, every time you meditate.  
### Exhaustive Focus
* 1-2: You may declare before drawing (and as long as there arent any cards removed from your deck by exhaustive focus) as many single card qualifiers as you have levels of Exhaustive Focus (2s or Matter for example but not "everythung but Aces"). When you draw a card with the described quality, remove it from your deck and draw another card. Removed cards may be added into the deck in ascending order, one per meditation. Exhaustive focus can be "undeclared" at any point, but can only be "redeclared" once all cards removed this way have been added back in.  
### Attune
* 1-7: While meditating, declare one card in your deck to be of a different Color. You can have as many cards attuned as you have levels in Attune, but only one Card can be attuned per meditation. For a card to not count as attuned it needs to represent its own color. (write down a list)  
### Channel
you may put the top card of the deck into the discard pile and then draw a card.  
### Greater Channel
you may put the top two cards of the deck into the discard pile and then draw a card. (seperately from channel)  
### Rebound
while you are spending at least one 2, pick a card in your discard pile and put it back into your deck.  
### Force the Attunement
You may use a charge to discard your entire hand, and draw as many cards as you like (including pausing and drawing more), discarding if you are past your handlimit, but not earlier. Then take damage equal to half of the total worth of cards in your hand.  
### Hasten
you may reduce casttimes by one turn if you additionally spend double the required material component. spells can not become instant this way.  
### Greater Hasten
you may reduce casttimes by one more turn if you additionally spend four times the required component. spells can not become instant this way.  
### Quicken
You may reduce the time your cards are dedicated by half by spending 15 Energy with the spell that dedicates a card.  
### Greater Quicken
You may reduce the time your cards are dedicated by half by spending 15 Energy and an Essence of Speed with the spell that dedicates a card. Alternatively, reduce a castingtime by up to 3 turns. Spells can become instant this way.  
### Substitue
You may use double the amount of a different Material Component of at least the same level in a spell by spending 15 Matter with the spell that uses the Component  
### Greater Substitute
You may use an Essence of Polymorphism instead of a Material Component in a spell by spending 15 Matter with the spell that uses the Component.  
### Equalize
If you spend 15 Order, All Magic requirements of a spells convert to Order for this turn. All your cards change type to Order for this turn. If the spell effects differentiate by type, you still have to split your magic up  
### Greater Equalize
If you spend 15 order and an Essence of Stability, you may choose a number from 0 to 9. All your cards are worth that much Order for this turn and all spell requirements become Order for this turn, for spell effect purposes you have to divide your magic up  
### Recommence
If you spend 15 Entropy with a Spell, instead of putting those cards into your discard pile, put them on the bottom of your deck. (except the entropy)  
### Greater Recommence
If you spend 15 Entropy and an Essence of Change with a spell, instead of putting those cards into your discard pile, keep them in your hand (except the entropy), put your hand on the bottom of the deck and draw as many cards.
### Cast while moving
What it says on the tin.

* 1: slow walk
* 2: regular movement
* 3: sprint'n'cast

# Spells
To cast the spell, spend at least the necessary magic and materials and roll as many dice as the task complexity commands. If concept.level or aspect.level is higher than the complexity, they refer to the highest rolled dice instead. Add dice as necessary (a good point to increase the complexity for more effects). Order the dice by value in ascending order.
valueOf(*concept.level*th dice)+valueOf(*aspect.level*th dice) is referred to as **roll** in the spell.

Complexities can be modified by the GM and by the player. For example to:

* increase/decrease casting time
* increase/decrease number of targets
* something you just thought up. It's more art than science. Actually it's not science at all.

**There are two kinds of spells here. Magical Alchemical Processes (P) and Magical Combat Alchemy (C) **

### Bend (P)
**Matter 4+ Order 3+ Entropy 3+**, Material component: 10g of wax. Allows bending up to 1 kg of material, doubles affected mass for every full 2 magic and 10g of wax expended past the requirements

**Casting time: 5 turns**, then the object can be bend by the caster in any reasonable way.  
Effects for a specific Roll:   

* 2-5  unnoticeable (edge alignment ruined for a sword)
* 6-8  slightly (banana shaped sword)
* 9-11 moderate bending (U turn in a sword)
* 12-14 further bending (pretzel shaped sword)
* 15-17 sharp bending (knotted sword)
* 18-20 pinpoint bending

no self intersection

**Duration: 1 Day per total magic expended**, Dedicate for duration, change then becomes permanent. If dedication is removed before duration ends, the material bends back over a time of 1 hour per additional magic expended (or one minute if none)  

### Lake of fire (C)
**Energy 3+ Entropy 3+**, Material component 100ml of alcohol (in at least 20% concentration)

**Casting Time: 2 Turns**

Creates an area of fire, damaging everyone in it every turn, and setting them on fire on impact or three subsequent hits. Roll-5 is divided between damage and duration to a maximum of total amount spend on energy for damage and total amount spend  on entropy for duration  

### Pandemonium (C)
**Entropy 11+ ?20**, Material component: one intricate clockwork ball

**Casting time: 3 Turns**

Creates an area of random transmutation, wildly varying compositions, explosions and the like.  Every turn, everything takes **the roll as damage**. Every time something of consequence (crafted objects or similar) is destroyed, the duration is extended for another turn, every time something dies, the duration is extended for five turns. All rolls within the pandemonium are halved.  

### Morph (P)
**Order 9+ Matter 9+**, Material component: one Essence of Change

**Casting Time: 5 Turns**

Morphs **1 kg** of material to a new shape desired by the caster. Detail is determined by the roll -8 compared to crafting success.
For **every magic** expended past the needed amount, **add 1 kg** to the affected mass. Requires **1 h per total magic spent - 2 h per Energy spent** and not used for additional mass (after reducing down to one hour, time is halved every step instead)  
(Order 10 Matter 10 Energy 20 would morph 2 kg of material in half an hour)  

### Static Charge (C)
**Order 5+ Energy 10+**, Material component: small magnet

**Casting Time: 1 Turn**

For every **3 Energy** spend past the needed amount, gain **one stack** (if stacks are 0, the shock is uncomfortable but not harmful, enough to interrupt though)  
Then choose a metal object. A Bolt of Lightning, travels from the held magnet to the metal object, from which the nearest Target is struck, dealing **(stacks*roll-8)* damage. One stack is lost and the lightning bounces to the next valid non-visited target from there, if there is a group, every person in that group rolls (Luck,Luck)[distance from the metal object in m] and are struck in ascending order of luck rolls. If stacks is 0 it bounces to two additional targets, dealing no damage and then stops.  

### Calcify (P)
**Matter 4+ Energy 4+**, Material component: crushed chalk, essence of stability

**Casting Time: 4 Turns**

The chalk powder is directed towards an area. Everyone in a roughly *5 meter radius* circle (or as far as the chalk powder is spread), feels a sort of numb pain, while their body calcifies.  
Concentrate for 2 for as long as the spell lasts.  
Everyone affected gradually **looses one from all movement based dice rolls and loses 10% movement speed and gains one armor per turn**, for roll-5 turns. The changes are permanent as long as concentration is upheld, then subside at a rate of one per turn.

### Calcination (P)
**Entropy 11, Energy 8**

**Casting time: 3 Turns**

Targeted Small to medium Object is engulfed in normal flames for either one turn (catches fire only if it normally would) or as long as the effect is sustained via concentration. It deals **roll/3 damage per turn** if cast on a living being and might catch things on fire. If the fire is extinguished, the Spell ends.  

### Solution (P)
**Matter 7 Order 10 Entropy 0+**

**Casting time: 1 Turn**

Up to **1 kg** of targeted object dissolves into any touching liquid, at a rate of **1 kg/min**, if normally possible (**max saturation is roll:8** by mass). Affected mass is **doubled** for every **3 eNtropy** spent beyond what is needed on this spell.  
**Duration: Dedication** As soon as the dedication ends, everything past normal solubility falls out of solution.  

### Separation (P)
**Order 9 Matter0+ Entropy 6 Energy 1+**

**Casting time: 3 Turns**

Separates **1 kg** of a sufficiently different component from a mixture. Total affected mass is **doubled** for every **3 Matter** spent beyond what is needed, rate of separation is **1 kg/h/3 spent Energy**. Needs to be sustained. Roll determines what can be separated, here some examples:  

* 1-5 Water and Oil
* 6-10 Salt from Water
* 11-15 Metal from Ore
* 16-20 Splitting Alloys

### Conjunction (P)
**Entropy 9 Matter 0+ Order 6 Energy 1+**

**Casting time: 3 Turns**

Mixes two very different components, **1 kg each**, into one compound. Total affected mass is **doubled** for every **3 Matter** spent beyond what is needed, rate of mixture is **1 kg/h/3 spent Energy**. Needs to be sustained. Roll determines how well things are mixed. 

### Putrefaction (P)
**Matter 14+ Energy 14+**

**Casting time: 4 Turns**

Targeted Organic Material begins rotting, turning black and hard with a rate of **1 kg/h**. *Mass* is **doubled** every **2 Matter** spent beyond what is needed, *Speed* is **doubled** every **2 Energy** spent beyond what is needed. Living things sustain **Roll/(10-Energy beyond what is needed/2)** (fractions accumulated, maximum Roll) damage per turn
