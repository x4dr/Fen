# Attunement Perks
3XP each. Might Change to also require and consume singular advancement point (tree depth = advancement level) in the future.  
Additional perks are open for debate.  
Might need translation.  
## Genius
* Genius 1: put a joker into your deck. jokers satisfy one magic type in a spell _completely_, but don't add anything to generic magic, OR they add 12 generic magic  
* Genius 2: put a joker into your deck, put a blank card into your deck.  
* Genius 3: put a joker into your deck, put two blank cards into your deck.  
## Amass Magic
* 1-13: you may put one card for each color into your deck, starting from the bottom (2 is the lowest, an Ace counts as highest), everytime you meditate. You can also remove the added Cards, starting from the top. You can only have as many extra cards per color, as you have levels in Amass Magic. Only one card can be taken out or added in this way, every time you meditate.  
## Exhaustive Focus
* 1-2: You may declare before drawing (and as long as there arent any cards removed from your deck by exhaustive focus) as many single card qualifiers as you have levels of Exhaustive Focus (2s or Matter for example but not "everything but Aces"). When you draw a card with the described quality, remove it from your deck and draw another card. Exhaustive focus can be "undeclared" at any point, but can only be "redeclared" once all cards removed this way have been added back in.  
## Attune
* 1-7: While meditating, declare one card in your deck to be of a different Color. You can have as many cards attuned as you have levels in Attune, but only one Card can be attuned per meditation. For a card to not count as attuned it needs to represent its own color. (write down a list)  
## Channel
* Once per Free Phase, as an Action you may put the top card of the deck into the discard pile and then draw two cards.  
#### Greater Channel
* When Channeling, you may discard immediately discard one of the cards drawn to draw another.
## Rebound
while you are spending at least one 2, pick a card in your discard pile and put it back into your deck.  
## Link to the placid Power
* You may now Link with a (standard) Energy Source. This requires 10 minutes of direct contact and inward Focus. The static and alien nature of this energy requires one Charge being spend on maintaining the connection, Immediately(after one Round) and once every 24 hours. If You have another way to link with a (standard) Energy Source, no Charge is required.
If you have to provide a charge and fail to do so, the Energy Source suffers feedback, empties and you take the square root of the lost energy points as damage. All drawn energy is increased by 1 per meter of distance to the Energy Source.
### Stir the placid Power
* 1-5: Roll Source and the Level of this Perk against 5 and subtract the roll from 20. This much energy is drawn from the source. If at least half the energy could be drawn out, you gain a Charge. Charges can be held for up to an hour. This is an Action.
#### Stabilize the riled power.
* 1-3: When spending a Charge would deal a damage to you, you may instead draw as many Energy Points from your source and negate the damage with them (4 - level of this perk) per damage negated.
### Draw Upon
* Spend a charge to immediately draw a card. This can be done at any time and doesn't require an action. Then take 1 damage.
#### Force the Attunement
* Spend a charge to discard your entire Hand, and draw as many cards as you like (including pausing and drawing more), discarding if you are past your handlimit, but not earlier. Then take damage equal to one tenth of the total worth of cards in your hand. This can be done at any time and doesn't require an action.  
#### Force the Cycle
* Spend a charge and shuffle your discard pile, then blindly divide it into any amount of piles. Reveal the piles and choose one. Shuffle it into your deck. Take one damage per card shuffled into your deck. The other piles return to your discard pile. This can be done at any time and doesn't require an action.   
#### Force the Foresight.
* 1-10: Spend a charge and reveal as many cards as you have levels in this perk from your deck. When drawing, you can instead pick any of these. You may take a damage when picking a card revealed this way, to then draw a card and replace the one you picked.


## Cast while moving  
While casting an Attunement based spell you may move with:  
|||
|---|---|
| 1| 10% original movement speed |   
| 2| 50% original movement speed |  
| 3| 100% original movement speed |    
| 4| 200% original movement speed |    
| |if 1 Energy is spend for every Additional meter.|  

Still no other rolls can be made while casting (so no sprinting)
