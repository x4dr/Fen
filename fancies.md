Military 
Bow - Range in combat
Horse - Extra Movement and speed
Lance - attack bonus per movement in a line
Regular -  Formation stacks, Adjacent Support
Infantry - Capturing
Irregular - No formations, no direct command structure
Pike - Reach, Armorpen, Formation bonus
Sword - Cheap, flexible, defensive
Axe - Cheap, offensive
Magic - Bonus depending on magic(movement, range, discipline), expensive
Healingsupport - prevents deaths on a strategic scale
Armor - costly, but strong defense


One Unit:
Number (Hp)
Discipline (Dp)
Morale (Mr)
Equipment (Eq)
Training (Tr)
Movement (Mv) (strategic)
Speed(Sp) (tactical)

Confrontation happens if one stack tries to move into a space which is occupied by another.

Both roll the Battleroll against Complexity of the Opponent:
+1 for having less than half as much morale as the opponent
-3-+3 for terrain
+1 for each defending unit after the first

Each Tactician rolls their mind+tactics roll against the Complexity of the Situation as determined by the GM

and interpret using Equipment and Training.
Range:
Units start at a distance of twice the maximum range and after each side attacks the next phase starts, units may move speed distance towards or away from the enemy per phase. 
(Orders Require Tacticpoints)
Once the engagement happens, Both stacks simultaneously inflict their casualties for every unit, repeated for every phase until one of the tacticians decides on a full retreat or all units shatter/die.

casualties per attack: (Number*BattlerollResult + Modifiers / 15+Opponents Armor), halved (rounded down) for ranged


Every casualty subtracts one from the units morale rating, and if it reaches 0, the unit shatters and starts retreating. Every time a unit rolls half or less of what the enemy rolled, another point of morale is deducted.

If one unit engages another that is moving away, the difference in speeds is the maximum casualties per phase. Units can move through each other. Each unit has a thickness of sqrt(Number)

some tactician stuff:
gain 1-3:1, 4-8:2, 9-13:4, 14-18:4, 19:5, 20:6
tactic points per phase. Maximum is Charisma,Command@TacticiansRoll.
advance: 6pt - units advance towards the enemy
fall back: 8pt - units walk backwards at max half speed while continuing to fight
retreat: 5pt units retreat at full speed, costs 1 morale.
surround: 6pt if units are on both sides of an enemy, attacking from both sides, grants not only better numbers but also +3 to the roll
Rethink: 2pt, reroll tacticians roll, but dont gain any points next phase
Reform: 10pt, reroll the Battleroll
establish order: 3pt, refill a units discipline by half their maximum discipline

Units that have been ordered loose one point of discipline, if no discipline is left, the unit either continues what it was doing, or if not possible attacks the nearest enemy (morale higher than half) or retreats(morale lower than half.
Units also loose one point of discipline for every 3 points of morale damage they inflict.



A: 1 Unit of 50 elite trained(5) and masterfully equipped(5)  Regular Armored(+10) Horse (speed 5) Lancers with Swords
vs 
B: 1 Unit of 50 well trained(4) and acceptably equipped(2) Irregular Archers (Range 20) on a Hill

A: complexity: 7
B: complexity: 4
A: Battleroll: 13.5
B: Battleroll: 12.97

4 Rounds of Archers:
(12.97*50) / (15+10) = 18.5/2 = 9
50-4*9
= 14

Round 5
A: (13.5+4)*50 /(15) = 58
B: 12.97*50 /35 = 18.5

Result: Complete annihilation... shit is lethal yo
