# Infiltrate

whatever infiltrating does



# Illusion

Uses stress or an spell charge thingy to make an illusion ... or something


# Not to be trifled With

You can push yourself to do one of the following: perform a feat of physical force
that verges on the superhuman—engage a small gang on equal footing in close combat.
PLAYBOOK:
When you push yourself to activate this ability, you still get one of the normal
benefits of pushing yourself (+1d, +1 effect, etc.) in addition to the special ability.
If you perform a feat that verges on the superhuman, you might break a metal
weapon with your bare hands, tackle a galloping horse, lift a huge weight, etc.
If you engage a small gang on equal footing, you don’t suffer reduced effect due
to scale against a small gang (up to six people).
