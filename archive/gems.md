# Magical Gems
## Gem Properties
Gems have 3 Properties: Their Energy, Maximum and Quality

Energy can only be between 0 and Maximum,
Maximum can only be between 0 and Quality,
Quality can only be lowered.

Energiedichte von Edelsteinen ist jeweils etwa 500 bis 2000 &times; Quadrat der kürzesten Distanz zweier gegenüberliegenden seiten in Metern ist.
 

## Magic Use

Magic users who use Gems usually drain their energy, and sometimes affect maximum or lower the quality.
Gems are replenished either by magic itself (usually in artifacts by people recharging them) or by a linked magic user with a source roll if he meets the condition given by his source and the gems in question.

## Loss of Capacity

Big magical events, magic clashes, gem characteristics, physical damage and other effects can reduce a gems maximum.
To restore the maximum, several things can be done, the most common is to recut the gem, which lowers the quality by 12-[jeweler roll]
and resets the maximum to the new quality.
