Kampf:
Phase 1 / "Free phase": unbound actions are announced and executed, combat actions can be announced, anyone who did not announce their action can react to an announced action
Phase 2 / "Combat phase" bound actions can be announced and may be executed if no combat happens, and then the combat performance is rolled and combat is executed from character with highest offense to lowest offense, triggers trigger immediately.
Attacking an enemy is a combat action. If it was spend on a non attack action, no attack is made.

Even if multiple attacks happen, the combat performance is not rerolled for bonus attacks.

Free attacks are a type of attack that does not carry the possibilty of retribution (or being attacked back) unless a technique states otherwise.

Someone who is inside a combat, can move up to 5m per round, but everyone may follow and keep that character bound in combat. If a bound character moves more than that amount, everyone hostile to that character may make a free attack (resisted by that rounds combat performance derived defensive score)
